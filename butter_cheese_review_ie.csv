"I didn’t get the flavor I was expecting, especially for the price. I wanted to love this so much.",Irish,Butter
"Kerrygold is not a dairy in Ireland. It is just an umbrella marketing brandname for many different dairies. In Europe this is not considered a premium brand, is very ordinary. It has a yellower color than American butters, I'll give it that. And But the taste is very, very disappointing to me. Many common brands and even the kind of butter served in cafeterias taste much better to me. I won't be purchasing it again.",Irish,Butter
This is an excellent butter for eating but terrible for baking. It makes my cookies fall apart and leaves a distinct salty taste. I will use it for table but never again for baking.,Irish,Butter
I purchased an 8 oz at the local Kroger for 3.99 I also purchased a pound of the Kroger brand butter well what a disappointment in the Kerrygold pure Irish butter Id much rather use the Kroger brand.,Irish,Butter
And I'm picky about the dairy I use. save your money this is good but there is cheaper out that that is even better,Irish,Butter
Drastically over priced,Irish,Butter
I don't know why this was so pricey. It's just butter.,Irish,Butter
"I've read that it's only 90% grass fed, but ""finished"" with soy and corn. Some women who have had breast cancer cannot eat soy because it acts like estrogen. Also, ""Grass-Fed"" should mean 100% grass fed shouldn't it???",Irish,Butter
Creamy smooth good texture nice butter,Irish,Butter
"this butter taste's creamer than the butter you get here. After buying it from the dealer, we found that Costco is now selling it.",Irish,Butter
Really good butter,Irish,Butter
"I thought I was buying the tub of easily spread butter, although the flavor was great. How do you choose the tub instead?",Irish,Butter
Wish I could find unsalted!!!!,Irish,Butter
It has great taste and last in the refrig for a longtiime .,Irish,Butter
Other friend had recommended this brand to me before.,Irish,Butter
"I bought Kerrygold butter at Sams Club after trying it at a friends house...She said if she was to eat butter it would have to be Good Irish butter. So with that note I decided to try it...At my friends when I tasted it for the first time we had a ton of food and with all the flavors I could not really tell ...to me it was ok.....So I decided to serve it to my family and not tell them what it was..After dinner I asked them how they liked the butter..my youngest who loves Kerrygold cheese told me it tasted like margarine and my husband said, ""its yellow"". and my son said ""its ok"" my opinion is that its ok.and I do like that it is so creamy..When I told them what the butter was... no one said anything except my husband who said ""Tell me you did not buy that""? So there ya go folks..ya either like it or ya dont!!! Probobly wont be buying it anymore.. However we do love the Kerrygold Cheese....By the way we are 100% Italian, could that be the problem? lol",Irish,Butter
"Today was the first time I've tried this butter after reading about it's high Omega-3 content, and of course it being grass-fed and non GMO. It does have a different taste, a little richer and not quite as salty. I'm lucky enough to have an Aldi near me that sells of a $2.65 for the 8-ounce.it seems a little goes a long way!",Irish,Butter
"I just bought this on a lark (not from Amazon), and I was pleasantly surprised: it has a very mild, smooth, creamy taste. At first, I thought that butter was butter, but I did a direct comparison (tasting small slivers of each back-to-back) with the Costco Kirkland Signature butter I had in the fridge, and I have to say the Kerrygold is superior and a lot closer to the fresh, smooth taste I remember spreading on fresh breads at European continental breakfasts. As a side note, the salted butter really isn't very salty (much less so than the other butter), which (to me) is a good thing, as I'm not much for salty flavors.",Irish,Butter
"I can no longer buy this in my state because I live in Wisconsin (the dairy state) and they don't like the competition. They will not allow the sale of any product without an FDA seal. They have also outlawed the sale of raw milk in my state. I am surrounded by cows and dairy farms but can't get raw milk. Go figure. Anyway, I bought this on a whim to see if it would actually be shipped to me and it was. It is nice to know I can get it somewhere, but I had to pay 10 dollars a 1/2 pound for it. So, it is reserved for special buttery things.",Irish,Butter
"Excellent butter. Compares well to Anchor brand from New Zealand, maybe even a bit better. Great flavor, very slightly sweet without overpowering anything with that at all. One can cook with this, but it is also great for use on toast or any other application where one eats butter, like on a baked potato for instance. Are there American butters that are good? Of course, I'm fond of Tillamook and Land O'Lakes. But this butter is a very nice indulgence for me as well, and just based on flavor I feel is a superior product.",Irish,Butter
"The ""Kerrygold Butter"" is simply delicious. Not too salty, not too bland. Just perfect. I do quite a bit of baking and is perfect for the breads I bake. I have not tasted or use the ""Anchor Butter"" yet.",Irish,Butter
"What did they do? THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT! THEY SHIPPED MY BUTTER RIGHT AWAY, AND IT WAS COLD AND READY TO GO WHEN I GOT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.",Irish,Butter
Outstanding seller for an outstanding product. Butter came to our very rural home still frozen! Best tasting butter in the world as far as we are concerned. We've even taken up bread baking because the butter is so good. Will definitely be ordering more from Savory Foods very soon. Thank you!,Irish,Butter
"This butter is great tasting. It came in an extreme box, with an ice pack and insulated pads. I thought that was overkill, but hey, now I have an insulated box in case I ever want to mail somebody raw meat. Good product.",Irish,Butter
I love the taste and that it is grass feed butter. The only thing I don’t like is that it finishes quickly. Is there a larger tub with butter in it?,Irish,Butter
"I am a huge fan of butter. I like to cook with it as well as spreading it on bread, crackers, toast, whatever... This butter is expensive no doubt about that. It is however the best tasting butter I have ever had. It has a rich deep yellow color, unlike the pale pasty generic butter you buy at the store. If you can afford it this butter is highly recommended",Irish,Butter
Love love this Kerry gold butter. Just wish I could afford to get more of this more often,Irish,Butter
Arrived well packed and cold. Put it in my fridge for a few days until I had a spot in my freezer for them. Will purchase again!,Irish,Butter
